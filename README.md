# expenses-tracker

A react-based app to record your expenses. Users can add their  daily expenses and the graph will show the percentage of their expenses..

demo: [https://jordon-chen.github.io/expenses-tracker/](https://jordon-chen.github.io/expenses-tracker/)

* This app consists of 4 components: UI, Expense, New Expense, and Chart.
* In the UI folder, we customize our Input, Card, and Modal [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#components).
* Writing [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#jsx) in function can help React DOM to render the template.
* Using [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#props) when data passed down from a parent component to a child component.
* Using [event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#events) to handle user input events.
* [Two-way-binding](https://reactjs.org/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html#linkedstatemixin-before-and-after) is set up to update the state to the real DOM.
* Using [conditions](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) to render messages when data is not available.
* Listing the contents through [dynamic lists of contents](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html).
* Styling the content with [dynamic styles](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style).[ ](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style)
